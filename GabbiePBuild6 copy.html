  <p class-"paragraph"> A little bit about me... I was born in San Antonio, Texas. I was adopted six days later. I grew up in New York. I am the oldest of six, and have five younger brothers. I went to the Professional Performing Arts High School in Manhattan. I am now a BFA Acting major with a minor in The Not for Profit Sector at Pace University. I am hoping to be on Broadway one day.</p>
